<img src="pexels-dayanrodio-4132936.jpg" alt="Book image1">
<p>I like reading books that really appear to be useful in my life. 
Rather than novellas and other literature <br>i prefer to read the ones which are informative. Personally, i would recommend to read these books:</p>
<ol type = "1">
<li> Lay, D.C. (2016). <i>Linear algebra and its applications.</i></li>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Linear Algebra and Its Applications by David C. Lay is a comprehensive textbook that introduces fundamental concepts of linear algebra,<br> 
		including vectors, matrices, and transformations, with an emphasis on practical applications.<br> 
		It is well-regarded for its clear explanations, numerous examples, and exercises that help students connect theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
		</li>
	</ul>
<li>Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L.,&Stein, (2009). <i>Introduction to algorithms (3rd ed.).</i> MIT Press.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This book is a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer algorithms, widely used in computer science courses.<br>
		It covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Laaksonen,A. (2018). <i>Competitive programmer's handbook.</i> CSC.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This book is a practical guide for competitive programmers, covering essential algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.<br>
			It is well-structured for both beginners and advanced readers, providing clear explanations,
			example problems, and insights to excel in programming competitions.
		</li>
	</ul>	
</ol>
<p>Of course books are recommended only if want to develop in IT sphere, else it will not suit your desires, because at some point they may seem boring.</p>
<h3 id="2">Solving Algorithmic Problems</h3>
<img src="OIP.jpeg" alt="Algorithmic picture">
<p>Usually i spend a time solving algorithmic problems sitting in various coding <strong>platforms</strong>
like <a href="https://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">codeforces</a> or <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>.
I also actively participate in contests or competitions where i can try my skills. 
<br> To be able to solve hard problems you need to maintain the knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. <br>As a quote from me
<blockquote><b>Never give up, work hard!!!</b></blockquote>
</p>
<h3 id="3">Learning new stacks</h3>
<img src="564d898952.png" alt="Stack picture">
<p>I regularly explore new technology stacks to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.
 <br>Recently, I’ve been diving into the MERN stack (React, Node.js) to build full-stack web applications. 
 But unfortunately, i barely understood what is React.
<br> Despite of that i have some skills in PgAdmin to make backups for servers or write some queries in PostgreSQL.</p>
<h3 id="4">Practicing Programming Languages</h3>
<img src="pexels-syirwan-ainu-542802837-27427258.jpg" alt="Programming picture">
<p>
I dedicate time each week to practicing some concrete programming languages. 
Lately, I’ve been focusing on Python for data analysis projects,<br> JavaScript for front-end development, and Haskell for more syntax knowledge. 
This approach allows me to understand each language’s <br>strengths and apply them effectively in various prospects.
I also know Java as an OOP language and try to practice sometimes for backend development.
</p>
<h3 id="5">Doing Sports</h3>

<img src="pexels-willpicturethis-1954524.jpg" alt="Real sport picture">
<p>
Sports are a great way for me to stay active and focused(Cybersports included). I go for a run in the mornings to boost my energy and focus for the day.<br> 
I also play Counter Strike 2 with friends on weekends, which not only keeps me mentally healthy but also helps me stay connected with my social circle.<br>
On other days, I enjoy strength training at the gym to increase stamina and stay in shape.
